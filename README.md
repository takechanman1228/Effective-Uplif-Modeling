# Uplift Modeling with CausalML

This repository contains materials related to Hajime Takeda's presentation on Causal Machine Learning and Uplift Modeling at [PyData London 2024](https://pydata.org/london2024/). The talk demonstrates how to measure treatment effect and run uplift modeling using the CausalML.
